-In this project my task was to create a quiz website using react router.
We were given two api's. One to load the topics from and the other to load the topic questions. I used tailwind for css and daisy ui for components.

-On the topics section when we click on it we see a hero banner and the topics.
When we press Start Practice, it takes us to another page dynamically creating a link. There we see our questions, if we click the correct answer it will display if the answer is correct or incorrect via a toast. 

-Now my next task is to show the answered correctly in statistics
